As I approach my thirties, I feel like life is beginning to overflow. This is a good thing - an abudnance of gifts and opportunities. But it can also be stressful and I have found that, even in the joy, it's easy to get off-kilter and out-of-focus of my deepest purposes. Although tools like [Getting Things Done](www.gtd.com) have helped me stay organized and up-to-date from a tasks persepctive, I have found myself in need of refreshing my spiritual backbone. 

Enter the spiritual disciplines. There's been a resurgence of interest in "mindfulness" and meditation and yoga -- but these are all part of a large project of keeping our spirits balanced. A more comprehensive approach can be found in Richard Foster's **A Celebration of Discipline**. It's a Christian perspective, but there's wisdom for all - especially in how only some of these disciplines are internal. More than half of them require others. A brief description of each is below. 

#### Inward practices

* Meditation: Clearing the mind by focusing on the present and perfect.
* Prayer: A communication outward - calling and listening. "The purpose of prayer is not to change the world but to change oneself."
* Fasting: An exercise of control over the body. A reminder of the body's frailty and the spirit's strength.
* Study: Searching and learning. Seeking explanations of the spiritual.

#### Outward practices
* Simplicity: Removing the clutter, both of "things to do" and "things to have".
* Solitude: Turning off the noise, including that made by loved ones.
* Submission: Letting go of our own ideas, our own drives, our own "needs". Giving over to the freedom of others.
* Service: Giving unto others and practicing love. 

#### Corporate
* Confession: Providing an honest accounting of ourselves to others.
* Guidance: Seeking mentorship and clarity.
* Worship: A returning to the basic joy of faith and life.
* Celebration: Life, love, death, welcome -- these are moments to be commemmorated as a group, not alone.
