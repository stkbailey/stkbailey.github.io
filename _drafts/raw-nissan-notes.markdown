Had a great opportunity to chat with two folks from Nissan as part of Vanderbilt's Data Science Colloquium. Danielle Beringer... Jason Snap...


### The $300,000 per day problem

Every day that a problem exists out in the manufacturing field costs Nissan between $100k and $300k. So being able to identify a problem as soon as possible is critical - whether it's a part from a factory or elsewhere. That's one o the major areas in which data is being used

But these sorts of analyses require standarization: often we use rates

### Big data driving change.

### Machine learning to standardize problems

One of the more interesting applications I heard about was using machine learning and NLP to identify and streamline customer comments. By applying a commmon method to data, its possible to get rid of some of the confusion that people from different backgrounds might get when reading something as messy as people's comments. Problems can then be rapidly filtered to the right teams and receive appropriate treatment.


### "If you want to connect the dots, you have to collect the dots."

Thye've been restructuring, building out the architecture to answer the questions, not just for now but for the future.


### "What would Tesla do?"

The automotive industry is under a huge shift, with self-driving cars right on the horizon. Planning out data architecture to accommodate it - and also the massive amounts of other data it will need (traffic, weather conditions, driver habits) is a massive undertaking, and the data isn't even there yet. 

Thus the need for 

In automotives, the data starts with Warranty information and Vehicle information. Nissan has a high degree of control over these variables, a. The rest is "seasoning". Repair orders... telematics data (live data from vehicles)

They track the customer journey, from viewing the first ad to 

### "Trust and value"

In a rapidly changing workplace, there are going to be employees who want to stick to their old ways (case in point, [Excel]()).

Technology is the easy part -- roles and an agile environment is important
