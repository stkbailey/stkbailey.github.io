1. The role of data in achieving precision and value in healthcare. Gregory Hager, Director of Malone Center at Johns Hopkins.
	- Healthare is a 3 trillion dollar industry -- accounts for about 18% of the GDP. Up to 1/3 of this can be chalked up to system inefficiencies. Further, medical erros are under-reported and could be considered the 3rd leading cause of death in the US. Thus, there's lots of opportunity.
	- Deep learning can be used for analyzing surgeries, especially those that have a lot of errors (a lot of re-visits). These include back surgeries, chronic rhinositis. By getting population-level understanding of morphological measurements of the back and nose, we can then map individual-subject measurements into this population space, determine whether a surgery can be effective.
	- There are many challenges  at the first mile (acquiisiton) and the last mile (deployment). 
	- "Many of the opportunities are in areas where there are engineering partnerships -- oopportunities for disruptive, revolutionary change, not incremental change. These things are happening at Mayo Clinic, JHU, Vanderbilt."

2. How will machine laarning and AI change healthcare practice? Suchi Saria
	- Dr. Saria went into detail about hte difficulties and objective of predicting individuals. 
	- The problem is similar to one of teaching a robot to walk: it needs to learn a sequence of operations, not just a single one. The data that you have, e.g. with sepsis, is that a person comes in at point X, but you really want to get the "latent system" profile which owuld show an increase before they get to the visit. Even predicting sepsis 12 hours before could lead to better care. 

3. Component model of AI in healthcare. Xu Chen from Winning Health
	- Four phases for the commeracilation of AI product: 
		- Talent, teams,
		- Overall efficiency
		- Product / data operations
		- Collaborative network ecology
	- Modularization of platform inspired by automotives. 
		- decopuling
		- fast iteration
		- customized deveopment
		- Standardizatio 
	- Components
		- Image processing, NLP, Medical data mining
	- Goals / products
		- Lab report generation
		- Clinical decision support
		- Bone age estimation
		- Lung nodule  detection
		- Chest X-Rays 
		- Four organ segmentation in chest CT
	- They applied the NIH dataset to real processes in the hospital.

4. Cascaded 3D fully convolutional networks for medical image segmentation. (Holger Roth, assistant professor at Nagoya University in Japan)
	- Multi-organ segmentation to provide quantitative analysis. Measure orgn volumes, shape irregularities, 3d printing and surgical navigation. It's challenging because of the anatomical variability especially in the abdomen.
	- Fully convolutional networks can be used to rain deep models for dense segmentation tasks. 3D U-net (Cicek et al.)

7. Towards theory of AI's mind...
	- Vicki is the AI agent . She's quirky. She has to provide a answer. But she's predictable in a quirky way. Human tasks: failure prediction and knwoledge prediction
	- For waht kinds of questions do they think people are going to better at: people think that number questions are better. ... But its actually the reverse -- it's the actual opposite of what people think. 
	- Most accurate people are programmers. Most optimistic are people who just recently heard about AI and the AI on TV. Least optimistic are people who use a personal assitant > 3 times a day.
