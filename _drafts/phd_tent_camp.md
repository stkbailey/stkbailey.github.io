> Quote from the moviegoer about vertical search 

Education is the process of "coming out" of the cave and seeing the Sun - reason and rationality, which shows ourp revious life as shadows and tricks. But the analogy lacks a sense of *time*. What then? Plato insists that we go back in, that we pull others out. 

But this enshrines reason: the reason has seen the light, the body follows. In reality, the mind is embeded within the body. It must continue breathing. It must go get water, food, take a rest. Are there mosquitos in the light? That would be annoying. There must be foraging and exploration, discussion and some trading if you want to live outside the cave.

That's the untold story of the "ascencion" model of education. During primary, secondary, undergraudate, even the Masters Degree, education is structured. Ostensibly, you're moving upwards and outwards. It's only in the PhD that you open the door and walk into the light. You're blinded by the radiance for a moment. But then you realize there's no further up to go. It's camps of people sitting around, all soaking up the sun. But no one is any closer. 

Some people are standing a little higher - they've flipped over a log and people have gathered around. But fundamentally, they are on the same level, and eventually someone will push them off the log. It's like a roller coaster that ratchets up and up (eek-eek-eek), you anticipate the ride down, the thrill, and then it just stops. And there's a platform, and you're told to get out. No going back, of course, but no thrill ride down -- only a little more work. But you can drop things a far way! and you have a lot of perspective.

That's the PhD.
