"Conversational machine learning"

Actually, machine learning has a fairly narrow focus: optimizing statistical models for big sets of data to make discrete classifications or predictions.

- Research goal: Teach a phone to do anything in its "sensor-effector closure". (*Anything things would be the best we could shoot for.) 
	* Sensors: GPS, microphone, acceleromter, etc.
	* Effectors: speaker, search web, alarms, etc.
- Outcomes: Currently, only the 1% of people who speak computer's language can tell it what to do. If we can teach the computer learn our language, *anybody* (99%) can teach the computer what to do.


What if, instead of Alexa saying, "I don't understand", he said, "
I don't understand. Do you want to teach me?"

Learning means, "learning new entries for the grammar / lexicon"

Scaling up -- how could you handle clobbering between different commands?

Mechanical turk subjects from the US with no programming knwoledge.

For condtions, it's a context learning problem - a set of states.

Next big areas... "reading" - if the machine can read the web. "experimentation", such as in robotics.
