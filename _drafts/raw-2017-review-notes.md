Christmas Card 2017

The Bailey Christmas card has a long and storied tradition. But this year, my father has had to add an appendix to it, so its high time for the "Nashville Baileys" to spin-off their own annual chronicle. 

The them this year has been "family". Daniel became mobile this year, meaning we got to introduce him to our favorite routines and places - our next door neighbor's house, ... 
Daniel got around this year, spending vacation time in Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Texas.

Daniel has hit several milestones this year: 
- Swam in the pool and lake
- First boating trip
- First words: "more"
- First sign language: fist-to-hand

Danielle and I hit other milestones: 
- First air conditioning unit to replace

2018 holds a lot of promise for our family:  I am on the cusp of becoming an adult (once again) and will graduate from Vanderbilt University this summer.

We are also expecting a second child, gender TBD. The due date is May 22.
