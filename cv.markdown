# Research Areas

## Predoctoral Research: Investigating the Neurobiological Basis for Individual Differences in Reading
Most of my current predoctoral research is focused on investigating the neurobiological basis for differences in reading skill. In my first published manuscript, I led an investigation into whether individuals with different profiles of reading deficits (dyslexia and specific reading comprehension deficits [SRCD]) could be differentiated from typically developing controls using structural imaging measures. We found that they could, suggesting that SRCD is not simply a less severe type of dyslexia, but a neurobiologically distinct condition. Other contributions include using diffusion-weighted MRI measures (e.g. fractional anisotropy) to predict reading improvement or individual differences in compensated readers. The research proposed here will continue this line of research by investigating the role of brain connectivity in skilled reading.

## Predoctoral Research: Investigating fMRI Signal in White Matter
A separate line of research that I am pursuing alongside Dr. Zhaohua Ding is the neurobiological significance of the functional MRI signal in white matter. In the past decade, many researchers have focused on what relationships between brain areas can tell us about the brain, cognition and its disorders. However, because of apparently lower signal-to-noise ratio in white matter, functional connectivity studies do not typically include the white matter tracts that facilitate communication between distant brain areas. However, preliminary evidence suggests that the fMRI signal may have valuable information for modelling these tracts (Ding et al., 2013). My contribution to this research has been in analyzing changes in this signal across development and in the context of language. Although this work is not the primary focus of my research, it complements the training and analyses proposed within this project, and I will continue to work with Dr. Ding when feasible.
