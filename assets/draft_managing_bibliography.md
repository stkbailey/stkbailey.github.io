Workflow for managing a bibliography

Bibliography can be one of the most frustrating things. 

1. Download Mendeley Desktop and create an account.
2. Set up a "add-to-mendeley" and an "organized" folder.
	* Reanme files
3. Download PDFs. use the "Search" and "Update details" tools to get meta-data.

When starting a project...
1. Create a new "group".
2. Add papers and collaborators. 
3. Export Bibtex file.
4. Use Latex or Word plug-in - but this will ensure everyone has the same papers.
