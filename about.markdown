I am always looking to learn, happy to help and up to an intellectual challenge. My interests include computer science, education, philosophy, psychology and, more recently, child-rearing. 

I am currently a student at Vanderbilt and looking to begin a career in Data Science. I have had the privilege of working with fantastic people on interesting projects, and hope to continue to do so in the next stage of my career. 

If you would like to reach me, please send me an email at [stkbailey@gmail.com](mailto:stkbailey@gmail.com).
