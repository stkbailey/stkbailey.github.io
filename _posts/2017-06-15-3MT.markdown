Earlier this spring, I had the chance to try my hand at Vanderbilt's Three Minute Thesis competition. I've done it the past three years, and I learn something new every time. (Last year, it was to stop on time...) To PhD students -- I highly recommend it! It's a great way to exercise those vital public speaking skills. 

If you're interested in watching this year's effort, check it out below -- and watch a few others. There are some very talented speakers at Vanderbilt.
