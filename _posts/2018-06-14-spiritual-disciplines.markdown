As I approach my thirties, I feel like life is beginning to overflow. This is a good thing - an abudnance of gifts and opportunities. But it can also be stressful and I have found that, even in the joy, it's easy to get off-kilter and out-of-focus of my deepest purposes. Although tools like [Getting Things Done](www.gettingthingsdone.com) have helped me stay organized and up-to-date from a tasks persepctive, I have found myself in need of refreshing my spiritual backbone. 

Enter the spiritual disciplines. There's been a resurgence of interest in "mindfulness" and meditation and yoga -- but these are all part of a large project of keeping our spirits balanced. A more comprehensive approach can be found in Richard Foster's **A Celebration of Discipline**. It's a Christian perspective, but there's wisdom for all - especially in how only some of these disciplines are internal. More than half of them require others. A brief description of each is below. 

#### Inward practices

* Meditation: Also called "contemplation" or even "mindfulness", meditation tunes out the noise, hurry and crowds that trample our inner peace.
* Prayer: Prayer is where change takes place -- it is marked by spiritual openness. As Kierkegaard says, "The purpose of prayer is not to change the world but to change oneself."
* Fasting: Fasting, especially in a society that values three large meals a day, is a spiritual exercise that can remind us how non-essential many of our "needs" are.
* Study: Through careful attention and study, the mind can move in a certain direction. Study allows for intellectual progress.

#### Outward practices
* Simplicity: This refers to both the spirit - "simplicity is freedom, duplicity is bondage" - as well as possessions. 
* Solitude: To be alone is to open oneself to God, to gain space needed for reflection and to learn to stand on one's own feet.
* Submission: Submission gives us the freedom to not have to always "get our own way", to not always have the solution and be the responsible party.
* Service: When done in an open and humble way ("who am I to serve today?"), service generates the grace of humility - and leadership. "If you are to do the work of a prophet, what you need is not a scepter but a hoe." (Bernard of Clairvaux)

#### Corporate
* Confession: Providing an honest accounting of ourselves to others has powerful redemptive power, as it is both an acknowledgement of our limitations and shortcomings as well as a public commitment to improve.
* Guidance: Seeking mentorship and clarity builds ties within the community and allows another avenue for spiritual guidance.
* Worship: The first commandment is "love the Lord your God", and worship is the exercise of that basic love and joy of faith and life.
* Celebration: Life, love, death, welcome -- these are moments to be commemmorated as a community, not by oneself.
