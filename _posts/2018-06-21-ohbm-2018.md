What a week! My second *Human Brain Mapping* conference was even better than the first. In addition to sharing my work during an oral session, receiving terrific feedback and networking with colleagues, I got to explore my new favorite foreign city: Singapore.

Everywhere I went, I was impressed by something new - nature? Miles of hiking and gardens are interspersed throughout the city. Food? You can get incredible meals for less than \$5 at hawker centers throughout the city. Transportation? The public transit systems are sanctuaries to the transportation gods, pristinely maintained and brimming with retail and life. Architecture? Don't get me started.

But this conference was also a graduation for me. It's my last scientific conference as a PhD student, and likely my last as a neuroscientist. I have such respect for the scientists that attend, and to be invited to share my work was humbling. As I've progressed throughout my PhD, I've come to realize how fundamental the social aspect of scientific research is. It's true that there are major innovations and insights that shake up a field, but the only way that impact can be felt is through the community of researchers that discusses then adopts those new ideas. Significant results are truly only half the battle - the other half is listening and being listened to, as well as the more active versions: attacking and defending ideas.

That's a frustrating truth when you're working your way up into those circles. But as you get closer, it simply becomes obvious. *Of course* your results will be more meaningful in a community that understands you clearly. *Of course* people will pay more attention to the people they like (or the ones they hate...). There is thus a **networking imperative** for anyone who wants to be successful. As I've learned over the past two years, this is actually quite easy, but it takes time, energy and humility. And then, once you've started building that network, you must invite others in -- science requires an open community. And I'm happy to have been a part of this one.
