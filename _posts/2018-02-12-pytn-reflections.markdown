I've been to many conferences as part of my PhD studies, but I can happily say that PyTN 2018 was the most enjoyable, worthwhile conference I've been to yet. I was constantly meeting new people doing interesting work in Nashville, and it made the Python Data Science community seem both larger and more accessible than it has before. 

You can find the slides for my talk, **Principles of Network Analysis with NetworkX**, [embedded online here](https://vanderbilt365-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/bailesk1_vanderbilt_edu/EefqHnnhzAZPmtyGXUARtXQBSIURVE53eH41nvbzvpbvrQ?e=89mHsJ) ([or with notebooks, etc. on Github](https://github.com/stkbailey/nashnetx)). Even better, you can play around with the code and data by forking the kernels [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/stkbailey/nashville-meetup). 

Some of my personal highlights from the talks were:

- **One degree to greatness**: Safia Abadalla gave an outstanding opening talk, packed with small proverbs. My favorite, especially during this season of networking and exploration, was that "you are always one degree away from someone who can help you do great things." Safia's personal journey certainly shows that hard work and openness to new experiences can rocket you from unknown quantity to celebrated contributor in a short time frame.
- **Be stylish**: A little gem from Anton McConville's talk was to be fashionable: when constructing sites or presentations, consult Pantone's seasonal [Fashion Color Report](https://www.pantone.com/fashion-color-trend-report-new-york-spring-2018) to get a pallette that is pleasing and updated. Check out any of his [very cool apps](http://ziggy.mybluemix.net/?cm_mc_uid=35044276203915184366502&cm_mc_sid_50200000=46629651518436650233) and see if you can disagree with the impact. 
- **Soup,  Selenium and Scrapy, oh my!** Great presentation on basic web scraping approaches with Trey Brooks. FINALLY got to learn how to do this formally and to see an expert in action. Check out the notebooks [on Github](https://github.com/treybrooks/ScrapingHospitals).
- **The Shirt Color Trick**: At conferences, ditch the talks and ditch your friends. Instead, pick a color and talk to the first person you see wearing that color (not blue or black -- those people are boring). 
- **Get schwifty**: An iron-clad rationale for breaking all the rules, courtesy of Eric Appelt:
	1. Children are masters at learning.
	2. Children learn by playing.
	3. Children play by being silly.
	4. Being silly means doing things intentionally wrong. 
	5. Being silly means doing things joyously wrong. 

Thanks to all the organizers and folks I got to hang out with. Looking forward to PyTN 2019!
