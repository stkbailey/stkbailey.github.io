Had a great chance to chat with John Berryman recently about the brain and how it might translate to building "thinking machines". Spoiler alert: we didn't get there. But we had a great chat about brain networks, sensory processing and different neuroimaging methods.  

He's written a nice overview of the chat on his blog -- [check it out here](http://blog.jnbrymn.com/2017/09/27/brain-scans).
