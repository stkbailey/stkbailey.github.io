Earlier this week, I met with Aliya Gifford to talk about getting into the "data science" field from academia. She had a lot of great insights into the job search process, and some really helpful ones for someone coming out of a PhD. 

- Start networking and scouting out jobs several months before starting to write the dissertation. Once the writing begins, everything else in the universe temporarily fades to nothingness. 
- Browse through LinkedIn profiles to get a feel for what sorts of experiences the people in jobs you want have. To do it stealthy, turn on Incognito mode. 
- Don't be afraid to cold-call alumni and others. Even if 1/10 respond, you've made progress.
- Get involved in the MeetUps, and don't just be a tourist looking for a job.
- Talk to someone who knows the industry to help translate your PhD work into the right "language". Interviewers interested in bottom-lines may not be interested in the fact that you correctly classified a CT image, but they might be impressed by the fact that your algorithm improved performance over existing methods by 70%. 
- Use new tools in your existing projects when you can (and maybe avoid Matlab). Academics is an excellent playground for learning these things. R, Python and SQL are core languages.

Thanks again, Aliya, for your time, and thanks to the rest of the [Penny U community](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/penny-university) for such a great platform!
