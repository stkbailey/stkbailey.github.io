It's launched! After eight months of development, my [DataCamp.com course on Biomedical Image Analysis](http://www.datacamp.com/courses/biomedical-image-analysis-in-python) is live and ready for viewing.

I worked on the course in the hopes that someone like me - a graduate student entering the field for the first time - would be able to learn the ropes in an accessible and comprehensive way. The course covers a number of fundamental topics, including:

* Slicing multi-dimensional data
* Understanding intensity distributions
* Masking data
* Convolutional filters
* Measuring morphology and intensity
* Affine transformations
* Image cost functions

When I was starting out, I had to pick these things up one at a time, and on my own. It's my hope that the course fills that niche and provides an enjoyable introduction to the field.

In the next few weeks, I hope to sit down and record some of my reflections on the course development.
