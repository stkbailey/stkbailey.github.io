This post is a summary of some reflections I've had on informal networking through
[Penny University](https://www.pennyuniversity.org), an organic little community that has
a vision of a virtuous "teaching and learning" cycle for personal development.

At a high level, I believe a Penny University platform would be a cross-between
Youtube and Stack Overflow, where Interviews take place and are recorded for
public viewing, and follow-up conversation could take place in the comments.
Like Stack Overflow, however, the Interviews would be fairly topical and may even
boil down to a bigger question: “How should I set up a data warehouse with Snowflake?”.

## What is the atomic unit of Penny University?

- For Twitter, it is the Tweet
- For Stack Overflow, it is the Question
- For Wall Street Journal, it is the Article.
- For Youtube, it is the Video.

For Penny University, the atomic unit is the Interview.

An Interview has an Interviewer and an Interviewee. It is between 15 and 60 minutes long, centered around a core subject -- usually one in which the Interviewee has expertise in, and which the Interviewer wants to learn about.

There can be additional attendees, of course, and in many cases the other attendees will actively participate in the discussion.

However, the Interviewer is responsible for moderating the discussion, guiding it to the key areas she wants to cover, and bringing it to a graceful end. She is responsible for ensuring that the Interviewee is thanked for their time.

## What are the steps to conducting an Interview?

- Interviewer poses a question.
- Interviewer finds and invites Interviewee to a meeting.
- Interviewer and Interviewee (and other attendees) schedule a time and establish a conference place or call.
- Interviewer creates an agenda with key topics to discuss.
- Interview is conducted. It is preferable that interviews are made public (on Penny University website, for example) and open for other attendees to listen in.
- Interviewer provides a synopsis of key points.
- Attendees and interviewee are able to provide feedback as well.
- Interview and metadata is made available to others.

## What topics are fair game?

The beauty of having the Interview be the fundamental unit is that it does not require a community to be worthwhile -- a good, one-off interview is satisfying and informative in and of itself, without additional context.

Therefore, all topics are fair game, but it would be wise to establish a core audience, so that the community can create a virtuous cycle between Supply (people who have specific knowledge) and Demand (people who want specific knowledge).

## What is in it for the Interviewees?

First, there is the innate value of providing guidance to peers. The Interview is designed to be more high level than a lecture -- there can be dialogue rather than simply explanation. However, it is designed to be open to people who may not be up to participating in the dialogue at that stage in their career.

Second, we may allow for direct payment (tipping) to the Interviewee. This would provide some small compensation for their time and energy.

Finally, should Penny University ever create a membership fee of sorts (it would be cool to have a totally peer-owned company, or something of the sort), then we could provide bonuses or compensation based on viewership, ratings, contributions to the community, or some other such measure. 

## Are there more patterns than Interviews?

There may be a couple different educational “patterns” in Penny U.

1. The Interview: you know you want to learn something, so you find a domain expert  and conduct a more focused interview with “purpose”. the purpose may be to learn about the other person’s experiences, nad not just content, though 
1. the hangout: you get connected to someone with a shared interest and have a more open-ended discussion. it’s not purposeless but “directed” is not a distinguishing feature. this was the “data nerds” template for a while.
1. the talk: a person gives a prepared talk on something they know, but perhaps with an emphasis on discussion following it
1. the study group: a group of people takes a look at a shared resource, such as a book, article or video, and then discusses the impact / high points /low points.

More of these patterns are discussed in this article, which Edward Ribeiro shared: http://www.industriallogic.com/papers/khdraft.pdf
