The first day of the NVIDIA GPU Technology Conference is about to close, and I am impressed. There's an amazing variety here: cutting-edge research, high-level overviews, outstanding tutorials. Below are some notes and thoughts, in no particular order:

- Today has also been the first time I've ever had to wait in line for the men's bathroom. 

- Tennessee had some great representation! At a talk on the state of AI in healthcare, Gregory Hager, the director of the Malone Center at Hopkins cited Vanderbilt as a model for creating an environment where revolutionary change could happen, because they have a focus on merging engineering and healthcare. Another slide that showed the list of top healthcare companies had many from Nashville / Franklin, including Healthstream, M-Model and Intersystems.

- Keras seems to be the toolbox to learn. Josh Gregory, a Tensorflow advocate from Google, basically told an audience as much in a presentation, citing the fact that you can go deeper when you need to, but can iterate more quickly with Keras. 

- Got to see a self-driving truck for the first time. Looking up at it is intimidating: it's giant rack of lights and cameras would make it the perfect interrogation background.

- Healthcare really seems poised to be transformed by deep learning. There are now forays into applying it "in the wild" - a presenter from Winning Health in China discussed how they have built an integrated platform to which they can add in new models as they're developed - they'e already integrated the NIH Chest X-Ray set from last year. No word on performance, though. 

- The image segmentation approaches presented were impressive. But the best part seems to be that, once trained, it's rather fast to segment an image compared to traditional methods - 100% faster, in some cases.
