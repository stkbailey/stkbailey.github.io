For two years I eyed the [Freewrite](www.getfreewrite.com), a sexy electronic
typewriter that promised me it would make me write more by ditching all the
distracting, trivial things that laptops provide. No browser, no Slack, no
programming console... no work or play, just time for me to focus on my writing
and the subsequent disgust at what I've written.

But the Freewrite is a steep $600 for the old edition, and the new "Traveller 
Edition" hasn't yet even come out yet. Even for someone who finally has a "real
job", the price required some serious justification. So I dreamed about it,
read reviews on it. I even brought it up with the wife a few times, but she
wanted some proof that I would actually write if I got one, since I hadn't
written much in the past few years voluntarily. (She doesn't understand the
writing process.)

I tried a simpler device - the Alphasmart Neo - which is
about as dumb a device you can get. If the Freewrite is the iPhone of e-Ink 
typewriters, the Neo 2 is the Motorala burner phone. In one forum I found, a
poster said she had purchased 20 of them so it could be available whenever the
urge struck her. But let me spare you the Stack Overflow questions and let me
just say that a device intended for children, created twenty years ago, that is
no longer supported, is not the most reliable word processor.

Then, the other day, we had our third child. I wanted to avoid my computer
on paternity leave but still have some space to "express myself". I added the
Freewrite to my cart, resigned that it was my last big purchase until the kids
went to colelge. But - before I clicked Buy Now, I scrolled a little further on
Amazon. A faint light shone into the hospital room, and a space in the search
results between Freewrite results and the promoted ads parted. 

In this space was a little device I had never encountered before in my searches:
The [Pomera DM-30](https://www.amazon.com/KINGJIM-digital-memo-Pomela-Silva/dp/B07CYTVH4Z).
An angel sent in my hour of need. An e-ink display. A full
word processor. Cute little folding keyboard. Free two-day shipping. And it was
$200, less than one-third of the price of the Freewrite.

I was in love, and not just with my newborn son.

The Pomera delivers everything I wanted -- an e-ink screen, a full keyboard,
portability. And it makes me feel like a quirky writer, rather than first grader
learning how to type (looking at you, Neo 2).

Out of the box, the DM-30 hearkens back to an age when electronics were "gadgets"
not "devices". Think RadioShack over Apple store. It is a Japanese product,
intended for a Japanese audience. Although it did take me a few minutes to figure
out how to prevent my essays from transforming into Kana randomly, it can be made
to function like any other English keyboard.

The video below will show you how it works.

I love this device, and at $200 on Amazon, the price is absolutely right when
compared to the Freewrite. This is an unusual market, in that I can't believe
there arent more options. As another reader said - what I want is a
"Kindle Paperwhite with keyboard". Well, I think the Pomera DM-30 is as close as
 you can get, if you want to stay in that pricepoint. Heres to many more blog
 posts written on it.
