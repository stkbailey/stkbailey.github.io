Brian Johnson is a VP of Product and Operatorions at DonorBureau. He came to Vanderbilt and gave a great talk on principles and tools to build your data science toolkit. 

Brian pushed the practical aspects of career-building hard. Don't need to learn about hardware to do your job? Then don't learn about hardware. Can the answers be done faster and more comprehensively by DataRobot? Fine - get a license to DataRobot rather than hire a new data scientist to your team.

His thesis is this: 80% of folks focus on the "science" aspect of data science. This is the sexy, complicated stuff that catches headlines when it performs well. But in business, 98% of what you care about is the "data" side of the equation. So if aren't a rock-start mathematician and you want to make it into the field, focus on leveraging data for value.

But he shared a few really great insights that I want to put out there:

#### Key Principles

1. **Begin with the end in mind.** What system will your product run on? What data will you have available? Work within the confines of the ultimate product, because that will bring more value faster.
2. **Never be good at something you don't want to do.** There's always a moment in the beginning of a new job where something goes wrong - the projector won't work, say. The new employee could step in to help... but if he does, he runs the danger of always being the "projector guy" until the end of time. If you don't want to do something, don't do it or don't do a good job on it.
3. **It's not how hard you work, it's how much you produce.** You get no bonus points for working all night long in business. You only get bonus points for adding value. Therefore, add value. 

#### List of tools / Things to learn

1. Learn SQL in a specific database.
2. Learn Python. (Has anyone heard of an "R developer"?)
3. Learn a cloud platform (Google Cloud, AWS, Azure).
4. Learn Google's BigQuery.
5. Use Google's DataLab to bypass local hardware.
6. Look into Data Robot.


Thanks, Brian, for an excellent (and original) talk!
