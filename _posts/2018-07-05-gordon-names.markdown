NBA star Gordon Hayward left the Utah Jazz in free agency last year when he signed for the Boston Celtics. Over the course of the next few months, as the Jazz regrouped and excitement built around the season, fans moved on... and forgot his name.

I always found the creativity hilarious, so to commemorate the joke, I scraped the /r/UtahJazz's last year of posts using pushshift.io, did some parsing to find phrases that had a "g\* h\*" or "h\* g\*" patterns, and compiled this visualization.

Scraping and plots done in Python. [The script is available as a GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/stkbailey/026176085c6aaa07dd21dcaf30976ee8).
