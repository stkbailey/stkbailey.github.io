I recently put together an audition of myself teaching a programming topic for the website [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), and I learned a lot! It was my first time doing a programming tutorial via screencast, and I thought I'd share a few pointers to people wanting to do the same.

First, the video:

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5jQVQE6yfio" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Now, the pointers!

- Powerpoint can record video and audio within the program, which would be a great option for people who don't need slides to be **perfect**. It can be a bit of a pain to go through and re-take recordings, though, so you should practice a few times first.

- If you need audio to be pristine, you can record yourself slide-by-slide in Audacity. Each slide should be its own "track", and you can export all of these at once. Then, you load them into Powerpoint using "Insert audio". 

- Powerpoint has an "export to video" feature that works great.

- For the "typing code" animation, I found the following to be effective:
	- Font: Consolas
	- Animation: Appear
		- Effect options: appear "by letter" with a 0.02 s delay
		- Timing options: appear "after previous"

- Talk fast! Every second is valuable to your students, and every pause is an opportunity for your student to get bored.
