  I am always looking to learn, happy to help and up to an intellectual challenge. My interests include computer science, education, philosophy, psychology and, more recently, child-rearing. 

  I am currently an NIH predoctoral fellow at Vanderbilt and looking to begin a career as a data scientist. My professional and academic research have covered a lot of ground: operations and logistics at Teach For America, adult education at Conexion America and medical image analysis at Vanderbilt. Most of all, I have had the privilege of working with fantastic people on interesting projects and hope to do so in the next stage of my career. 

  If you would like to reach me, please send me an email at [stkbailey@gmail.com](mailto:stkbailey@gmail.com).
